## A Wide World for Adventure

The Realms are designed for breadth and are perfect for a Westmarches-style campaign. Players can step into a bustling frontier town, explore the ruins of lost empires, or set sail across perilous seas. Each region offers a unique flavor, from the mercantile cities of the Sword Coast to the shadowy depths of the Underdark.

## Why the Forgotten Realms?

**Familiar yet flexible:** The Realms provide a shared foundation that's easy to step into, while still leaving room for new tales.

**Rich history:** Countless novels, campaigns, and modules have been set here—but your character's story will be uniquely their own.

**Diverse adventures:** From political intrigue to dungeon crawls, the Realms can host it all.

## Our Corner of the World

At the heart of our play-by-post is the town of Triboar—a crossroads settlement in the northern Sword Coast. It's a springboard for exploration, where characters return between quests to share news, recruit allies, and leave their mark on the world.

## An Invitation

You don't need to know every map or timeline to join. The Forgotten Realms are meant to feel alive, not intimidating. Step into the story where you are, bring your character to life through writing, and discover how your path intertwines with this setting.
