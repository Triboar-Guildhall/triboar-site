Every member of the Triboar Guildhall has the same access, the same opportunities, and the same story potential—regardless of what they pay.

## One Price, No Tiers

Everyone pays the same monthly dues. There are no premium memberships or hidden levels. What you pay never determines what you're allowed to play.

## Not Pay-to-Play

Unlimited quest access, unlimited roleplay, and full community participation are included for every member. The only limits are time and imagination.

## No Paid Advantages

You cannot buy XP, gold, items, boosts, or shortcuts. Characters grow through writing, choices, and exploration—not spending.

## Flexible Membership

Stay as long as the adventure calls. Membership is month-to-month, and you can pause anytime.

## Alternate Contributions

Dungeon Masters receive free membership for running quests. Volunteers can earn dues credit by helping with moderation, lore, maps, or other tasks. These are contributions—not tiers.

## Optional Special Events

We may occasionally host fun one-off activities or server-wide events, but they never provide mechanical advantages or replace regular play.

At the Triboar Guildhall, fairness is the rule. Everyone starts at the same crossroads—what you build from there is entirely your story.
