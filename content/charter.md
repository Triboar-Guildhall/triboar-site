## Purpose

The Triboar Guildhall exists to bring together storytellers, writers, and roleplayers who want to explore the Forgotten Realms through collaborative, play-by-post adventures. Our goal is to create a space where creativity thrives, stories unfold at their own pace, and everyone feels welcome at the table.

## Core Values

**Collaboration** – Storytelling here is shared. Every character matters, every post builds on the last.

**Respect** – We honor each other's time, contributions, and creative choices.

**Consistency** – Reliability helps our stories grow. When you commit to a game, your fellow players depend on you.

**Imagination** – We celebrate bold ideas, unusual characters, and original twists.

**Growth** – We encourage learning, feedback, and the chance to try new styles of play.

## Membership

Membership is open to all who share our passion for storytelling and agree to abide by this charter.

Members may participate in one or more campaigns, join community discussions, and contribute to world-building efforts.

Members are expected to contribute to the community both in and out of character, whether by writing, helping organize, or supporting others.

## Dues

Dues help cover the costs of running the server and ensuring the community has the resources it needs to thrive.

Members in good standing who contribute dues gain full access to play-by-post campaigns, resources, and community activities.

## Code of Conduct

Treat others with courtesy. Discrimination, harassment, or personal attacks will not be tolerated.

Keep disagreements respectful—focus on ideas, not people.

Respect content boundaries. If a theme makes you uncomfortable, communicate clearly and kindly.

Uphold the spirit of fair play. Metagaming and rule-bending undermine the shared story.

## Governance

The Guildhall is guided by the Guild Council, a small group of volunteer moderators and organizers.

The Council helps organize campaigns, resolve disputes, and manage resources.

## Amendments

This charter may be amended by consensus of the Guild Council, with input from members. The guiding principle is always to preserve fairness, creativity, and community spirit.
