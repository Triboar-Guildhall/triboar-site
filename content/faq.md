## What is Triboar Guildhall?

Triboar Guildhall is a play-by-post (PbP) community for tabletop roleplaying games, primarily set in the Forgotten Realms. We're writers, storytellers, and adventurers who build shared stories one post at a time.

## What is play-by-post?

Play-by-post (PbP) means the game unfolds through written posts in Discord instead of live voice sessions. Each player writes their character's actions, thoughts, and dialogue; the Dungeon Master (DM) responds with narration, NPCs, and the unfolding story.

PbP is:

- **Flexible** – write when you can, no need to schedule a full session.
- **Immersive** – explore characters in greater depth, with time for detailed writing.
- **Collaborative** – the story grows from everyone's contributions.

## Do I need to know D&D rules to join?

Not at all! While we mostly play in the Dungeons & Dragons 5e 2024 ruleset, many members come for the storytelling first. The Guildhall is a supportive place to learn the rules as you go.

## What makes this community different?

- **Writing-focused:** we emphasize strong narrative and character writing.
- **Shared world:** all games take place in the same ongoing Forgotten Realms setting.
- **Community-driven:** members help shape adventures, lore, and the overall feel of the Guildhall.
- **Fair and respectful:** guided by our Charter and Code of Conduct.

## How do I become a member?

1. Join the Discord server.
2. Introduce yourself in the welcome channel.
3. Review the Guild Charter and agree to the Code of Conduct.
4. Support the Guild by contributing dues (see below).
5. Once approved, you'll gain access to campaigns, character creation, and writing channels.

## Why are there dues?

Running a high-quality PbP server takes time, energy, and resources. Dues help cover costs such as:

- Server and tool hosting
- Digital resources for players and DMs
- Art, maps, and reference materials
- Community events and activities

Dues ensure the Guildhall remains sustainable and fair for everyone.

## How much are dues?

Dues are intentionally kept modest to remain accessible. Specific amounts and payment instructions are available in the server.

## What is the Guild Council?

The Guild Council is a small group of moderators and organizers who help keep the Guildhall running smoothly. They:

- Support Dungeon Masters
- Mediate conflicts
- Manage dues and resources
- Maintain the setting and lore

## How are campaigns run?

- Each campaign is led by a Dungeon Master.
- Players post their actions in campaign threads.
- Posts may include dice rolls, narration, and dialogue.
- DMs keep the story moving, ensuring a balance of pace and depth.

## How fast do I need to post?

Most campaigns aim for several posts per week, but pace varies by group. Communication is key—if life gets busy, let your DM and fellow players know.

## What kind of characters can I play?

We welcome all sorts of adventurers, as long as they fit within the Forgotten Realms setting. Exotic races or unusual backstories may need DM approval, but creativity is encouraged.

## Are homebrew rules allowed?

Yes—with DM approval. Some campaigns use official rules only, while others allow homebrew. The Guild Council and DMs coordinate to keep things balanced.

## How do I become a DM?

Dungeon Masters are always in demand! Interested members should:

- Have some familiarity with 5e 2024 rules
- Be reliable in posting regularly
- Have a story idea that fits the shared setting
- Talk with the Guild Council for approval and support

## Can I be in more than one campaign?

Yes, as long as you can keep up with the posting pace in each. Balance is encouraged so no story suffers from neglect.

## How do disputes get resolved?

Most issues can be solved with respectful conversation. If needed, the Guild Council will step in to mediate, guided by the Code of Conduct.

## How do I leave the Guildhall?

Life happens! If you need to step away, just let your DM or the Council know. You'll always be welcome back.

## Can I invite friends?

Yes! We grow through community and welcome referrals. Please make sure friends understand the Charter and FAQ before joining.

## Where can I learn more about the Forgotten Realms?

The Guildhall includes a Setting Guide with key details about the Realms, plus links to deeper lore for those who want to explore further.
