## About the Guildhall

### What is Triboar Guildhall?

Triboar Guildhall is a play-by-post (PbP) Dungeons & Dragons community set in the Forgotten Realms. We're writers, storytellers, and adventurers who build shared narratives one post at a time in a persistent Westmarches-style world.

### What is play-by-post?

Play-by-post means the game unfolds through written posts instead of live sessions.

- You write your character's actions, thoughts, and dialogue.
- The DM responds with narration and NPC actions.
- The story advances one post at a time.

It's ideal for anyone who can't always attend scheduled sessions and enjoys thoughtful, creative roleplay.

### What makes this community different?

A few things:

- **Writing-first:** We emphasize character, story, and prose.
- **Flexible play:** Asynchronous posting means you play on your schedule.
- **Shared world:** All quests shape the same evolving Forgotten Realms setting.
- **Fair membership:** One price, no premium tiers, no purchased power.
- **Guides & tools:** Support for both play-by-post and tools like Avrae.

### Is this just for beginners?

No. We welcome both experienced players and those new to PbP or 5e.

- Veterans enjoy structure, consistency, and a stable world.
- New players get tools and support without being treated like beginners.

## Membership & Dues

### How do I become a member?

1. **Join the Guild** – Start your membership on our website. Every new subscription includes a **30-day free trial**
   (*for a limited time, trials are extended to **90 days***).
2. **Join the Discord server** – You'll receive the invite link after subscribing.
3. **Create a character** – Follow our step-by-step guide.
4. **Start playing** – Once approved, you can join quests, roleplay scenes, and downtime activities.

### How much are dues?

Membership is **$9 USD per month**, billed after your **30-day free trial**
(*or promotional 90-day trial*).

- Equal dues for everyone
- No premium tiers
- No paid mechanical advantages
- Pause anytime with no penalty

### Why are there dues?

Dues help support:

- Bot and server hosting
- Maps, art assets, and world resources
- Moderation and staff work
- Downtime systems, crafting rules, and record-keeping

They ensure long-term sustainability and fairness.

### What do I get with membership?

Every member receives:

- **Unlimited quests**, roleplay scenes, and downtime activities
- Access to a **persistent, shared Forgotten Realms**
- Structured downtime systems (jobs, crafting, hunting, fishing, etc.)
- **Quest Guarantee:** At least one quest you can join each month—or your next month is free
- Guides and support for PbP and Avrae
- A fair, respectful community guided by the Charter

### Is this pay-to-play or pay-to-win?

No. You cannot pay for XP, items, gold, or power.
Membership influences **access**, not **character strength**.

### Can I pause my membership?

Yes.

- Pause anytime—no staff approval needed.
- You remain in the server and keep your character records.
- You simply lose access to quest/roleplay/downtime channels until you resume.

### What happens if I leave the Discord server?

Leaving the server (not the same as pausing membership) should only be done **with notification to staff**.

Leaving without notice may result in:

- Character records being archived or deleted
- Forfeiture of active characters and rewards

If you may return, pausing is the better option.

## Play & Pacing

### What system do you use?

We use **Dungeons & Dragons 5e (2024 rules)** as our base system, with some documented house rules.

### How fast do I need to post?

For quests:

- Please post within **24 hours** during active play.
- If you can't post, communicate with your DM/group.
- Missing 24 hours in combat may cause your character to take a **default action** (usually Dodge).
- Repeated pacing issues in a quest may result in removal from that quest only.

Open RP scenes move more loosely, but communication is always appreciated.

### How many quests can I be in at once?

Each **character** may only join **one quest at a time**.

You may use different characters to participate in multiple quests, as long as you meet pacing expectations.

### Can I have multiple characters?

Yes. You unlock additional character slots as you play:

- Reach **Level 5** → 2nd character slot
- Reach **Level 10** → 3rd slot
- Reach **Level 15** → 4th slot
- Reach **Level 20** → 5th slot

Each character must be created through the Guildhall process.

### Do I have to use Avrae or other bots?

We use **Avrae** extensively for:

- Dice rolls
- Combat automation
- Downtime systems
- **Inventory tracking**

We provide guides, templates, and staff support.
Our goal is smooth play, not technical stress.

## Characters & Rules

### What kind of characters can I play?

We use **core D&D sourcebooks** (2014 + 2024), not third-party or partner content.

Characters may originate from other D&D settings (Eberron, Ravenloft, Ravnica, etc.) as long as they can fit into the Forgotten Realms.

Starting characters begin at **Level 3**.

### Are homebrew rules or content allowed?

Possibly.
There is a review process for homebrew submissions.

- Evaluated case-by-case
- High priority on maintaining mechanical balance
- Approved content is documented for consistency

Balance and fairness remain core principles.

### Can I help in other ways?

Yes—volunteers may contribute to:

- Maps and visual resources
- Lore organization
- Tools, automation, and record-keeping

Volunteers may earn dues credits.

### How are disputes handled?

## Other Questions

### Can I invite friends?

Absolutely. Every new member begins with a free trial and must follow the same onboarding steps.

### Where can I learn more about the Forgotten Realms?

We offer a **Setting Guide** to help you navigate our corner of the Realms, plus links for deeper lore dives. You don't need to be a lore expert to play.

Ask in the server—staff are always happy to help.
