## About the Guildhall

### What is Triboar Guildhall?

Triboar Guildhall is a play-by-post (PbP) Dungeons & Dragons community set in the Forgotten Realms. We're writers, storytellers, and adventurers who build shared narratives one post at a time in a persistent Westmarches-style world.

### What is play-by-post?

Play-by-post means the game unfolds through written posts instead of live sessions.

- You write your character's actions, thoughts, and dialogue.
- The DM responds with narration and NPC actions.
- The story advances one post at a time.

It's ideal for anyone who can't always attend scheduled sessions and enjoys thoughtful, creative roleplay.

### What makes this community different?

A few things:

- **Writing-first:** We emphasize character, story, and prose.
- **Flexible play:** Asynchronous posting means you play on your schedule.
- **Shared world:** All quests shape the same evolving Forgotten Realms setting.
- **Fair membership:** One price, no premium tiers, no purchased power.
- **Guides & tools:** Support for both play-by-post and tools like Avrae.

### Is this just for beginners?

No. We welcome both experienced players and those new to PbP or 5e.

- Veterans enjoy structure, consistency, and a stable world.
- New players get tools and support without being treated like beginners.

### How do you feel about AI?
AI is an emerging reality in many apsects of life, and has a particular sensitivity in creative spaces. We may change our opinion over time, but at the moment we don't see a reason to ban it's use, and certainly shaming members that use it to some degree will not be permitted.

We prefer that your text-based roleplay be in your genuine voice. You will find that your scene partners and fellow adventurers will respond better to it, and that stories will flow more naturally from it. Roleplayers that feel disconnected from the story will be encouraged to write collaboratively regardless of whether or not the text was generated by AI.

AI-generated character art is fine (although there are lots of artists that commission art at reasonable prices). Using AI to explore rules or to get plot ideas can be helpful. We have an AI chatbot named Glyph that can help with Avrae commands. We don't hate AI - we just prefer that it not get in the way of meaningful story building.

   (*for a limited time, trials are extended to **90 days***).
2. **Join the Discord server** – You'll receive the invite link after subscribing.
3. **Create a character** – Follow our step-by-step guide.
4. **Start playing** – Once approved, you can join quests, roleplay scenes, and downtime activities.

### How much are dues?

Membership is **$9 USD per month**, billed after your **30-day free trial**
(*or promotional 90-day trial*).

- Equal dues for everyone
- No premium tiers
- No paid mechanical advantages
- Pause anytime with no penalty

### Why are there dues?

Dues help support:

- Bot and server hosting
- Published D&D resource books through D&D Beyond content sharing
- Other maps, art assets, and world resources
- Moderation and staff admin work
- Maintenance of downtime systems: crafting, survival games, jobs

They ensure long-term sustainability and fairness.

### What do I get with membership?

Every member receives:

- **Unlimited quests**, roleplay scenes, and downtime activities
- Access to a **persistent, shared Forgotten Realms**
- Structured downtime systems (jobs, crafting, hunting, fishing, etc.)
- **Quest Guarantee:** At least one quest you can join each month—or your next month is free
- Guides and support for PbP and Avrae
- A fair, respectful community guided by the Charter

### Is this pay-to-play or pay-to-win?

No. You cannot pay for XP, items, gold, or power.
Membership influences **access**, not **character strength**.

### Can I pause my membership?

Yes.

- Pause anytime—no staff approval needed.
- You remain in the server and keep your character records.
- You simply lose access to quest/roleplay/downtime channels until you resume.

### What happens if I leave the Discord server?

Leaving the server (not the same as pausing membership) should only be done **with notification to staff**.

Leaving without notice may result in:

- Character records being archived or deleted
- Forfeiture of active characters and rewards

If you may return, pausing is the better option.

## Play & Pacing

### What system do you use?

We use **Dungeons & Dragons 5e (2024 rules)** as our base system, with some documented house rules.

### How fast do I need to post?

For quests:

- Please post within **24 hours** during active play.
- If you can't post, communicate with your DM/group.
- Missing 24 hours in combat may cause your character to take a **default action** (usually Dodge).
- Repeated pacing issues in a quest may result in removal from that quest only.

Open RP scenes move more loosely, but communication with your scene partners is always appreciated.

### How many quests can I be in at once?

Each **character** may only join **one quest at a time**.

You may use different characters to participate in multiple quests, as long as you meet pacing expectations.

### Can I have multiple characters?

Yes. You unlock additional character slots as you play:

- Reach **Level 5** → 2nd character slot
- Reach **Level 10** → 3rd slot
- Reach **Level 15** → 4th slot

Each character must be created through the Guildhall process.

### Do I need a Discord account?

Yes. All gameplay, communication, and community interaction happens on our Discord server. Discord is free to use and works on desktop, mobile, and web browsers.

If you don't have an account yet, you can create one at [discord.com](https://discord.com). Once you subscribe, you'll receive an invite link to join the Guildhall server.

### Do I have to use Avrae or other bots?

Yes. **Avrae** is a Discord bot that automates dice rolling for exploration, combat, and skill checks. It handles most of the mechanical side of play so you can focus on storytelling.

Beyond combat, Avrae also powers our downtime systems—jobs, crafting, shopping, inventory tracking, and more. If you're buying a potion or selling loot, Avrae keeps the records.

There is a learning curve. We won't pretend otherwise. But we provide guides, and staff support to help you get comfortable. We also have an AI chatbot names Glyph that can help with constructing commands. Most members pick it up quickly, and you don't need to master it before you start playing.

## Characters & Rules

### What kind of characters can I play?

We use **core D&D sourcebooks** (2014 + 2024), not third-party or partner content.

Characters may originate from other D&D settings (Eberron, Ravenloft, Ravnica, etc.) as long as they can fit into the Forgotten Realms.

Starting characters begin at **Level 3**.

### Are homebrew rules or content allowed?

There is a review process for homebrew submissions.

- Evaluated case-by-case
- High priority on maintaining mechanical balance
- Approved content is documented for consistency

Balance and fairness remain core principles.

DMs receive **free membership** while running quests.

### Can I help in other ways?

Yes—volunteers may contribute to:

- Moderation and community support
- Maps, visual resources, and lore organization
- Tools, automation, and record-keeping

Volunteers earn dues credits.

### How are disputes handled?

Most issues resolve through respectful conversation. Staff intervene when needed, using the Charter as guidance.

- Educate first

## Other Questions

Absolutely. Every new member begins with a free trial and must follow the same onboarding steps.
