Players can step into a bustling frontier town, explore the ruins of lost empires, or set sail across perilous seas. Each region offers a unique flavor, from the mercantile cities of the Sword Coast to the shadowy depths of the Underdark.
Why the Forgotten Realms? Familiar yet flexible: The Realms provide a shared foundation that&amp;rsquo;s easy to step into, while still leaving room for new tales.</description></item><item><title>Triboar Guildhall FAQ</title><link>https://triboar-guildhall.github.io/triboar-site/faq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://triboar-guildhall.github.io/triboar-site/faq/</guid><description>About the Guildhall What is Triboar Guildhall? Triboar Guildhall is a play-by-post (PbP) Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons community set in the Forgotten Realms. We&amp;rsquo;re writers, storytellers, and adventurers who build shared narratives one post at a time in a persistent Westmarches-style world.
What is play-by-post? Play-by-post means the game unfolds through written posts instead of live sessions.
You write your character&amp;rsquo;s actions, thoughts, and dialogue. The DM responds with narration and NPC actions.</description></item><item><title>Application Submitted</title><link>https://triboar-guildhall.github.io/triboar-site/application-submitted/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://triboar-guildhall.github.io/triboar-site/application-submitted/</guid><description>Thank You!
