Players can step into a bustling frontier town, explore the ruins of lost empires, or set sail across perilous seas. Each region offers a unique flavor, from the mercantile cities of the Sword Coast to the shadowy depths of the Underdark.
Why the Forgotten Realms? Familiar yet flexible: The Realms provide a shared foundation that&amp;rsquo;s easy to step into, while still leaving room for new tales.</description></item><item><title>Triboar Guildhall Charter</title><link>https://triboar-guildhall.github.io/triboar-site/charter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://triboar-guildhall.github.io/triboar-site/charter/</guid><description>Purpose The Triboar Guildhall exists to bring together storytellers, writers, and roleplayers who want to explore the Forgotten Realms through collaborative, play-by-post adventures.

Triboar Guildhall is a play-by-post (PbP) community for tabletop roleplaying games, primarily set in the Forgotten Realms. We&amp;rsquo;re writers, storytellers, and adventurers who build shared stories one post at a time.
What is play-by-post? Play-by-post (PbP) means the game unfolds through written posts in Discord instead of live voice sessions. Each player writes their character&amp;rsquo;s actions, thoughts, and dialogue; the Dungeon Master (DM) responds with narration, NPCs, and the unfolding story.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://triboar-guildhall.github.io/triboar-site/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://triboar-guildhall.github.io/triboar-site/privacy/</guid><description>Last Updated: November 30, 2024
